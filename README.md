# HTML5-Cheatsheet-Website
This is a website created to help anyone who needs a more visual representation of how a website is structured and created using HTML5 with Bootstrap 5. It shows HTML5 code in a more digestable look, and as a website that you can either "inspect source" to use the code from the website, or you can just scroll all the way to the bottom of the website to copy the code instead of "inspect sourcing" constantly.
