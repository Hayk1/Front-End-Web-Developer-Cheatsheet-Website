# Front-End Web Developer Cheatsheet Website
This is a front-end website developed with the software "Bootstrap Studio" to help anyone who needs a more visual representation of how a website is structured and created using HTML5, CSS, and Bootstrap 5. It shows HTML5 and HTML styling code, in a more digestable look. As a website in a folder, you can either "inspect source" to use the code from the website, or you can just scroll all the way to the bottom of the website to copy the code instead of "inspect sourcing" constantly.
